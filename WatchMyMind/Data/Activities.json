Mindfulness is a quality that every human being already possesses, it’s not something you have to conjure up, you just have to learn how to access it.",

These improvements in mood are proposed to be caused by exercise-induced increase in blood circulation to the brain and by an influence on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal(HPA) axis and, thus, on the physiologic reactivity to stress",
